    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am Mohsin Raza, currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Applications (MCA) from Saraswati College, Shegaon. 
    I have always been passionate about computers and technology, which inspired me to build a strong academic foundation through BCA and now MCA. 
    My goal is to become a skilled full stack developer who can create impactful applications that solve real-world problems.
    Along with technical knowledge, I enjoy learning about cybersecurity, data analytics, and artificial intelligence. I believe in continuous learning and enjoy experimenting with new tools and technologies.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h3>Employee Management System (2025)</h3>
    <p>This is a web-based enterprise-level application developed using JSP, Servlet, and MySQL as part of my MCA final year project. 
    It provides a role-based system where Admin and Employees can log in to manage their respective tasks. 
    The system includes modules for attendance tracking, leave requests, salary breakdown, and task assignments. 
    I used Bootstrap to make the interface mobile responsive, and session tracking to manage secure logins. 
    This project helped me understand full stack development and server-client architecture.</p>

    <h3>Bank Management System (2024)</h3>
    <p>A desktop application built using Java Swing and MySQL that simulates real-world banking functions like deposits, withdrawals, balance checks, and fund transfers. 
    I implemented all major functionalities with proper UI components and used MySQL to store transactional data. 
    The project follows object-oriented design for easy updates and maintenance. It was a great way to apply core Java knowledge in a practical setting.</p>
